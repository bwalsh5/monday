Take it, you can't man up?

Back again, young man?\nI remember you from way way when\nYou never gave it or reciprocated\nBut when I bounced for my sake, you peeped your mistake\n\"She left me\" is always the excuse\nI swear there should be support groups for men without Lizzo\nMeet once a week and deal with y'all issues\nGoogle me and jack off in a tissue\n[Hook]\nYeah! You know what though?\nWe keep it going up\nMake it go around, around, again\nAnd we keep it going up\nGoing up\nAnd we keep it going up\nMake it go around, around, again\nAnd we keep it going up\nGoing up\n\n[Verse 3]\nI will never be the person that you want me to\nFeeling like I can't amount in what I'm 'sposed to do\nBut I'm here now, like how this happen?\nHead in the pillows, I'm crunching on Cap'n\nI'm chilling, I swear I been chilling\nTaking a break, feeling hella breakable\nI was taught that life has no regrets and no mistakes, no no\nBet I made some, granted\nBut my heart cold bruh, definitely definitely granite\nWrote this song halfway to Chicago\nWondering if I should call you\nWhat, to make you feel special?\nWould it give me reasons to forget you?\n(Hey, you reached Lizzo. Leave me a message..)\nI'm out of state, out of time\nYou more like out of sight, out of mind\n[Hook]\nYeah!

    "lyrics": "My Skin Lyrics[Intro]\nLearning to love yourself and like learning to love your body is like a whole journey that I feel like every person, but more specifically, women, have to go through so I feel like doing this is a good way to kinda break through and kinda seal the last chapter of the \"learning to love\" and just loving..\n\n[Verse 1]\nOoh, what's deeper than, what's deeper than the darkest best\nKept secret? Beneath the surface, we could\nLet it bring us together, or it could tear us apart, oh\nI'm filled with it, I gotta love with no conditions\nThough it's hard to re-envision time and time again\nEven when, even when it didn't matter anymore\nThe most beautiful thing that you ever seen\nIs even bigger than what we think it means\nReflections in my bloodstreams, it's even bigger than\n[Hook]\nI woke up in this, I woke up in this\nIn my skin\nI can't wash it away, so you can't take it from me\nMy brown skin\n\n[Verse 2]\nReal world, big girl meets world\nA crazy position, now your dreams is your mission, huh?\nStaring in the mirror, realizing, wish it worked\nNow all I wish is for a chance to give my kids a Ford\nI got a family tree that's worth praising the Lord\nMama looking like the second, whoo! Look at God\nSister like a soldier, hold it down\nSouthwest gon' hold it down, uh\nI love you, don't forget it, you beautiful Black masterpiece!\nBoy, they don't make brothers like you\nUh, make it happen with that Black girl magic\nThe hat trick off of what we must do\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nPardon me, just left a message to the city\nWords stuck between my teeth, so gritty\nPay him for each minute I'm seething\nA Black girl mixed with a little bit of Sacagawea\nI pocket subpoenas, I swallow my pride and my ego\nI wear my flaws on my sleeve and my skin like a peacoat\nI see someone like me ashamed to be\nAnd honestly, I'm really really\nI'm fed up wit' it, try to send it up like a FedEx\nI'm wondering what they sayin' next\nCan't pretend to not hear it\nIt's your beauty, they can't have it\nIt's yours, they can't have it\n[Interlude]\nI'm done with the struggle. I wanna-I just wanna enjoy my life now and maybe appreciate my skin..\n\n[Extended Hook]\nI woke up in this, I woke up in this\nIn my skin\nI can't wash it away, so you can't take it from me\nMy brown skin\nOh, I can't wash it away\nNo, you can't take it from me\nMy skin, your skin, yeah!\nOh, I can't wash it away\nNo, you can't take it from me\nOoh, my skin, ooh, my skin, yeah!\n\n[Outro]\nThis is something I was born wit', you know? You can't buy this at a store, so hey..1Embed"
