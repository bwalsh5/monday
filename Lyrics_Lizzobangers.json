With your oompady-doo like\n\"Ding dong, the witch ain't dead, you better look out 'fore she chop yo' head!\"\nBreaking bread with the queens at the dinner table\nLapdogs eat scraps if you're able\nMaybe throw you a bone if I feel like it\nMaybe give you some steak if the mood right\nRight now, homie, bow down\nLooking at my head like my head need a crown\nCrown on the rocks, nigga, weed in the box, nigga\nGive me if you got figures, what I want's a lot bigger!\n[Chorus]\nWhat you mean\nWhat you mean\nWhat you mean\nTo me, to me, to me, to me\n\n[Verse 2]\nLizzo be eating though, Lizzo be hungry\nLizzo Big GRRRL Small World till it ain't funny\nSay my name three times like I'm in destiny\nYo-ho-ho and a bottle of Four Loko\nChillin' with my niggas in the back like mane\nCame a long way, umbrellas for the rain\nIf you came this far, you better play the game\nBecause success and fame be two different things\nI remember being sad about boys and stuff\nBut that was way back in middle school\nNow I'm making crowds make noise and stuff\nAnd all my people back home like, \"who knew?\"\nNormally I don't like to toot my own horn\nCause I don't got a car yet and, well, that sucks\nBeing a rapper these days ain't what it seems\nMan, really you ain't making all the big bucks, but I'm killin' it\nI'm just saying that I'm feeling the wheeling one would experience\nWhile wheeling and gripping the wheel and gettin' it\nAnd my limericks be the same thing that get me on the cover, trick!\n[Chorus]\nWhat you mean\nWhat you mean\nWhat you mean\nTo me, to me, to me, to me1Embed"

Hardly, I feel lazy\nI was eating ph\u1edf when I wrote this\nFever, 103\nMet some cool Minnesotans, but really\nSome of y'all need a lesson from Lazerbeak\n\n[Outro]\nI rock that\nRock that, rock that\n(Baby)1Embed"

    "lyrics": "Be Still LyricsI wake up every morning feeling like slapping a nigga\nSqueeze trigger, stay scheming then I realize I'm still dreaming\nOops, psych! Believing in believers ability to still scream for a nigga till you get nosebleeds\nI be so scuffed up from kicking them rocks\nAnd if you're so tough come run up and get clocked\nTick tock tock tock\nIf you got them slippery socks\nYo I'mma give it all that I got\nTo make a nigga slide in the vault\nThen bake a nigga dash in some salt\nI bring a nigga home and pole vault\nThen blame a nigga like it's your fault\nYour bad!\n(It's your fault!)\nI never understood and I will never understand\nThe tolerance for ho-ishness that some of you people have\n\"ME?\" You, yeah you\nI'm talking to the middle man\nLike how you're content with giving someone else the upper hand\nWalking around your cubicle, your tie with your coffee mug\nSiphoning the hard earned work from the thugs and hustlers, cuz\nTakin a chill pill before I whip my sword out like Uma in Kill Bill\nMakin niggas gasp like Emmett Till\nAnd I'mma keep on giving you the gospel like God's will, Peace! Be Still\n\n\nThis is God's will peace be still\nThis is God's will peace be still\nThis is God's will peace be still\n\nCan I fall in love before the world ends?\nCan my record get a few major spins? I'm saying\nI don't wanna think about tomorrow because I'm still hustling\nUntil then, I guess it's just me, you, theses food stamps and cravings\nNo raisins in the sun, just Funyuns and a Sunkist, we up in the club making it mist\nLike a missed alcohol (though I see it every night)\nAnd that Tylenol I take everyday period like Midol\nBye y'all, I'm moving on to other things by y'all\nBut not quite bilateral, more like three floors up and down the hall\nLet the bygones be bygones, and try to keep the peace like Obama and Biden\nAll my friends are talented, all my friends got mad skills\nAll my girlfriends wear heels, all my niggas drug deal\nWe're tight (psych!)Embed"
