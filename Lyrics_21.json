Is this really it?\nYou're giving up so easily\nI thought you loved me more than this\n\n[Chorus]\nBut go on, go on and take it (Take it)\nTake it all with you\nDon't look back (Don't look back)\nAt this crumbling fool\nJust take it all with my love\nTake it all with my love\n\n[Bridge]\nI will change if I must\nSlow it down and bring it home, I will adjust\nOh, if only, if only you knew\nThat everything I do is for you\n\n[Chorus]\nBut go on, go on and take it (Take it)\nTake it all with you\nDon't look back (Don't look back)\nAt this crumbling fool\nJust take it (Take it)\nTake it all with you\nDon't look back (Don't look back)\nAt this crumbling fool\nJust take it all with my love\nTake it all with my love\nTake it all with my love13Embed"
